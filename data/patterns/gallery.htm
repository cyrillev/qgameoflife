	<td>In February 1989, I started a tower in my office, made out of empty
	Coke cans.  Such towers tend to be fairly sturdy, since the bases of
	one level are held firmly in place by the pull-tabs on the next lower
	level.  By Christmas, it had reached 10 complete levels (385 cans),
	so I put a star on top to make a Christmas Tree.<br><br>

	In March 1990, when Laszlo Morocz came in for a job interview, he
	insisted that somebody need to throw a football at the tower, so when
	he was hired, I promised him the honour.<br><br>

	In September, the tower had penetrated the ceiling, 14 cans high and
	11 wide, a total of 960 cans.  We got out the camera and cam-corder for
	the tearing-down ceremony, and Laszlo threw the football.  Only 2-3
	cans fell.  He then put two phone books in to a box, and tried again.
	This photo is the result.  I was lucky to catch the box just after it
	hit the cans before any had actually fallen.  Afterwards, it took about
	a minute for the falling cans to settle.  The remains filled seven
	garbage bags.<br></td>

	<td>I took this around 11 AM on March 16 1991.  It is a view directly
	south at the Mayfield/I-271 interchange on Cleveland's east side.
	This photograph as such would now be impossible to take, since
	express lanes have were added in the middle of the I-271 in 1994.
	The photo was taken from a Cessna, which was being flown by
	Laszlo Morocz.<br></td>
