<h2>David Buckingham</h2>
David Buckingham significantly expanded the lists of known
<a href="lifeterm.htm#still">still-lifes</a>,
first listing the 12-bits (simultaneously with <a href="#petrie">Petrie</a> and
Boyer), first listing the 13-bits, and using <a href="#raynham">Raynham's</a>
search program to first list the 14-bits.<br><br>

He found many <a href="lifeterm.htm#oscillator">oscillators</a>,
including literally hundreds of billiard-table configurations, as well as
a basic <a href="lifeterm.htm#puffer">puffer train</a>.<br><br>

He developed most of the existing technology used in glider synthesis of
still-lifes, oscillators, and <a href="lifeterm.htm#spaceship">spaceships</a>,
and methodically generated syntheses of all still-lifes and oscillators up
to 14 bits, as well as many larger ones.<br><br>

In 1996, he revealed a suite of track components which use eaters and other
still-lifes to move can move a Herschel heptomino (the 20th generation of
<a href="6bh.rle">B-heptomino</a>, after it has left behind a block).
By combining several of these, in much the same way as one assembles toy
train tracks, one can produce circular conduits which take arbitrarily long
to cycle a single Herschel.  By placing multiple Herschels in such a conduit,
one can obtain oscillators of arbitrarily small periods.  (These were
improvements over his earlier track components which used spark-producing
oscillators as stabilizers;  unfortunately, those can only produce oscillators
whose periods are multiples of those of the spark-producers.)<br><br>

Oscillators of all periods 58 and above can be obtained in this way.
Since Herschels naturally release gliders, this also yields glider guns of
all periods 62 and above.  (The Herschels collide with each other if closer
than 58 generations apart, and they collide with the escaping gliders if
closer than 62 generations apart.)
Recently, Dietrich Leithner has constructed oscillators of periods 57 and 56
by adding in one of Buckingham's earlier spark-stabilized sections.<br><br>

This is basically a variation of the method described by
<a href="lifecred.htm#conway">Conway</a> in the 1970's to construct
oscillators of arbitary period using stable glider-reflectors.
(Currently, all known stable glider-reflectors are derived from the above,
turning a glider into a Herschel, shuttling the Herschel, and then turning
the Herschel back into a glider.)<br><br>

<h2>Paul Callahan</h2>
Paul Callahan has expanded <a href="#buckingham">Buckingham's</a>
Herschel conduit mechanisms, building stable glider reflectors.<br><br>

He has also maintains a
<a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~callahan/lifepage.html">web page</a>
which includes a compreshensive
<a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~callahan/patterns/contents.html">
Life pattern catalog</a>, and a

<a name="coe"></a>
<h2>Tim Coe</h2>
Tim Coe found the <a href="28coelw.rle">period-16 puffer engine</a>,
which is itself a clean <a href="lifeterm.htm#spaceship">spaceship</a>,
but which has easily ignitable exhaust, facilitating construction of many
<a href="lifeterm.htm#puffer">puffer trains</a>.<br><br>

He has also recently discovered a new small
<a href="17coep8.rle">P8 oscillator</a>, and a collision of 11 gliders which
which eventually produces a natural <a href="12ca.rle">Caterer</a>.<br><br>

<h2>John Horton Conway</h2>
In the early 70's, John Horton Conway invented the
<a href="lifeterm.htm#life">Game of Life</a>.
He did much of the original research into Life, laying most of the game's
basic mathematical foundations.<br><br>

He found many of the small
<a href="lifeterm.htm#still">still-lifes</a>,
<a href="lifeterm.htm#oscillator">oscillators</a>
(including the <a href="p3pu.rle">Pulsar</a> and
<a href="12pc.rle">Pentadecathlon</a>), and
<a href="lifeterm.htm#spaceship">spaceships</a>
(<a href="5gl.rle">Glider</a>,
<a href="9lw.rle">Light-weight spaceship (LWSS)</a>,
<a href="11mw.rle">Middle-weight spaceship (MWSS)</a>, and

<h2>Noam Elkies</h2>
Noam Elkies has found several oscillators, including the period-36
<a href="p36et2t2.rle">Two eaters hassling two T-tetrominos</a>,
a new <a href="20elkies.rle">period-5 oscillator</a>,
and the infinitely-expandable Traffic-Jam oscillators.<br><br>

He has also proven that the density of Life still-lifes
cannot exceed 50%.<br><br>

<a name="flammenkamp"></a>
<h2>Achim Flammenkamp</h2>
Achim Flammenkamp performed many experiments on random Life fields,
collecting statistics on object artificiality.  In the process,
he found many never-before-seen naturally-occuring (though extremely rare)
<a href="lifeterm.htm#oscillator">oscillators</a>,
such as the <a href="p4achim.rle">Dual 1-2-3-4</a>,
the P5 <a href="15ap.rle">Pseudo barber-pole</a>,
the P8 <a href="17sm.rle">Smiley</a>, a <a href="p16achim.rle">P16</a>,
and a <a href="p144achm.rle">P144</a>.<br><br>

His results are available on his
<a href="http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/~achim/gol.html">web page</a>.<br><br>

<a name="gosper"></a>
<h2>R. William Gosper</h2>
Bill Gosper found some of Life's basic shuttle-based oscillators,
including <a href="20qb1.rle">Queen Bee</a>,
<a href="p46tw.rle">Twin Bees</a>, and
<a href="p100cent.rle">Centinal</a>.
He first proved that Life patterns could expand forever by constructing
the first <a href="lifeterm.htm#gun">glider gun</a>, and subsequently
<a href="lifeterm.htm#puffer">puffer trains</a>.
He subsequently also proved that Life patterns could expand quadratically
by constructing the first <a href="lifeterm.htm#breeder">breeder</a>, by
having a flotilla of puffers which construct glider guns.<br><br>

<a name="hickerson"></a>
<h2>Dean Hickerson</h2>
Dean Hickerson wrote the first oscillator search program, which
found many new <a href="lifeterm.htm#oscillator">oscillators</a>,
including some small ones like the <a href="12ca.rle">Caterer</a>,
<a href="12md.rle">Mold</a>, and <a href="13jm.rle">Jam</a>.
This program also found the first spaceships other than the
natural ones found by <a href="#conway">Conway</a>.
He has recently written another search program which has found many
new billiard-table oscillators, including the first period 17.<br><br>

He also found glider syntheses of several large objects which
occur naturally in contrived situations, as well as the first
four-glider synthesis of the <a href="8tt.rle">Tub w/tail</a>.<br><br>

<a name="koenig"></a>
<h2>H. Koenig</h2>
H. Koenig has performed many computer object searches, verifying
<a href="#buckingham">Buckingham's</a> and
<a href="#niemiec">Niemiec's</a>
<a href="lifeterm.htm#still">still-life</a> counts up to 18 bits,
and period 2 <a href="lifeterm.htm#oscillator">oscillators</a> up to 16 bits,
(as well as making several minor corrections to some of these lists.)<br><br>

He has also collected statistics on many randomly-occuring Life objects and
oscillators, the results of which have resulted in improved glider syntheses
of some of these.<br><br>

He has recently found a previously-unknown three-glider synthesis of the
<a href="12pc.rle">Pentadecathlon</a>.<br><br>

He maintains a
<a href="http://www.halcyon.com/hkoenig/LifeInfo/LifeInfo.html">web page</a>
which includes lists of objects and many glider syntheses,
an alternative to the information contained here.<br><br>

<hr>
<a name="niemiec"></a>
<h2>Mark D. Niemiec</h2>
Mark D. Niemiec has found several oscillators, including the
period-9 <a href="p9sr1.rle">Snacker</a>.<br><br>

He expanded on <a href="#buckingham">Buckingham's</a> enumeration results,
generating complete lists of <a href="lifeterm.htm#still">still-lifes</a>
and <a href="lifeterm.htm#pseudo-still">pseudo-still-lifes</a>

<a href="lifeterm.htm#oscillator">oscillators</a> and
<a href="lifeterm.htm#pseudo-oscillator">pseudo-oscillators</a>
up to 19 bits.
He has also listed larger-period oscillators and pseudo-oscillators up to
20 bits by hand, although these still await computer verification.<br><br>

He has expanded on <a href="#buckingham">Buckingham's</a> glider synthesis
results, generating syntheses of many 15-bit still-lifes, all
pseudo-still-lifes up to 15 bits, many remaining period 2 oscillators of
15-18 bits, most period 2 pseudo-oscillators up to 19 bits,
and most higher-period oscillators and pseudo-oscillators up to 20 bits.

Niemiec is also the author and maintainer of these Life pages, which show
many of the above object lists and syntheses.<br><br>

<a href="14-507.rle">Sidewalk (14.507)</a>, and the previous optimal
(for twenty years) four-glider synthesis of the
<a href="12pc.rle">Pentadecathlon</a>.<br><br>

He wrote the first program to search for
<a href="lifeterm.htm#still">still-lifes</a>,
verifying the lists created by <a href="#wainwright">Wainwright</a> and
<a href="#buckingham">Buckingham</a>, and which Buckingham used to expand
the state of the art to include the 14-bit still-lifes.<br><br>

<a name="wainwright"></a>
<h2>Robert T. Wainwright</h2>
In the early 70's, Robert T. Wainwright published
<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~hilery/life/">Lifeline</a>,
a newsletter devoted to discoveries about <a href="lifeterm.htm#life">Life</a>,
and sometimes other similar cellular automata.  Many of the original
discoveries in Life were first published in Lifeline, and Lifeline served to
foster much interest in Life, which was then still in its infancy.<br><br>

Wainwright began the first efforts to systematically list the
<a href="lifeterm.htm#still">still-lifes</a>, assembling lists up to 11
bits from various partial lists submitted by various Lifeline readers.<br><br>

He also found many <a href="lifeterm.htm#oscillator">oscillators</a>,
including <a href="15br.rle">blocker</a>, and a basic
<a href="lifeterm.htm#puffer">puffer train</a>.<br><br>
